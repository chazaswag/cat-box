# cat-box
A small and simple game i have made while learning lua. protect the cat box with the shields.
The game was created using this as a guide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY2b0_9cbX4&list=PLYBJzqz8zpWYip5ZkTMQiOkqya9Iiefm9 though im still learning this was an attempt with what i have learnt so far of lua and Love2d.
Protect the cat with a shield using w,a,s and d. You get score for each thing you block. if you lose you lose. This took about 4 hours. Yes i suck at coding.
